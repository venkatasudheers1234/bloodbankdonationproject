Using this system user can search blood group available in the blood bank and he can also get contact number of the donor who has the same blood group he needs. In order to help people who are in need of blood, this Online Blood Bank management system can be used effectively for getting the details of available blood groups and user can also get contact number of the blood donors having the same blood group and within the same city. So if the blood group is not available in the blood bank user can request the donor to donate the blood to him and save someone life.
