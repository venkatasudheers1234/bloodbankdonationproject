**Lifeline: The Comprehensive Blood Donation System**

This project is designed to streamline the process of blood donation and management. This system enables donors to register and donate blood at blood banks while assisting medical centers in collecting blood from these banks. The project is developed using PythonAnywhere, Django, HTML, CSS, and SQLite on the Windows Operating System.

## **Goal**
The objective of this report is to provide clear specifications and a comprehensive concept of the system's implementation. This project introduces innovative dimensions, making it both engaging and challenging. The primary aim of this system is to provide blood to individuals in need. As the number of people requiring blood donations increases, this system allows users to search for available blood groups in the blood bank and access contact information for donors with the required blood group. The Online Blood Bank Management System facilitates efficient access to blood group information and donor contact details within the same city, enabling direct requests for blood donations if the required blood group is not available in the blood bank.

## **Problem Definition**
With increasing awareness, the percentage of people donating blood is growing. Efficient management of the collected blood is crucial to ensure the safety and health of recipients.

## Objective
This online blood donation system is easily accessible to everyone. Donor registration is straightforward, requiring users to fill out a form with details such as blood group and contact information. Hospitals must register to place orders for blood. They can search for needed blood groups online and, if unavailable, contact registered donors directly to request donations, thereby helping save lives.
